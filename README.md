# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Simple rock, paper, scissors application made with HTML, CSS and Javascript!
The idea is to make the user face the computer in the classic game of rock, paper and scissors. There's 5 matches to play, and the winner is displayed at the end of each match!

## How does it work? 
There is 5 matches to play. After each click on one of the emojis the game function - compareChoices() - is ran. It takes user's choice as a parameter which is passed to it when the eventListener is activated after each click on one of the emojis.

There are three variables declared from the start; win, loss and draft.

# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Simple rock, paper, scissors application made with HTML, CSS and Javascript!
The idea is to make the user face the computer in the classic game of rock, paper and scissors. There's 5 rounds to play, and the winner is displayed at the end of each match!

## Game logic
This branch is focusing on making the game work on the website with use of Javascript and the DOM.

## The starting point
The logic of the game is partially built, and works in the console. The conditionals which check user's choice, the computer's choice and finally compare those is working in the console. Next "todo" is make this logic work on the front-end using DOM.
